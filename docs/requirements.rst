Common Data Service Requirements
================================

This document presents the abstract data model implemented by the Acumos Common Data Service.
The data model is explained in terms of entities in the system, attributes of the entities,
and relationships among the entities.  These requirements are implemented in a relational
database, but this page does not define table names, column names, data types, lengths, etc.

Support for Federation
----------------------

The Acumos system is intended to be federated. This has implications for identifiers used 
in the system, because they will have to be usable globally:

* Multiple systems will be running in different organizations
* Information will be shared selectively across the systems
* A public "root" instance will be used to publish some information
* Users can publish their solutions for use by others.

Entity and Relationship Overview
--------------------------------

Entities in the system are the main items that users create and manipulate, including solutions,
solution revisions, solution artifacts. For the purpose of CDS a user is also an entity, to track 
name, credentials and so on.  To name another example, federation peers are also entities.

Solutions and revisions are in a one-to-many relationship; a solution may be considered just a 
collection of revisions. Similarly a revision is just a collection of artifacts. Users are in a 
many-to-many relationship with most of the other entities in the system.

Entity and Attribute Details
----------------------------

All entities and attributes are listed below, grouped into three sections:

* Simple code-name entities (readonly pairs of values)
* Complex entities
* Relationship (mapping) entities

     -  Very likely to be stored as a binary file in a Nexus repository, so the URL to the file can be stored as an attribute.

*    Unique ID for system use, a generated UUID to be globally unique

*    Type

     -   An artifact type can be either a statistical model, metadata, docker image or TOSCA file (and TBD).

*    URL

     -   Using this, the artifact image can be retrieved from a Nexus repository

*    Owner ID

     -    The person's ID who created the artifact and is the owner of it.

*    Create time

      -  Time when the artifact is created

Below are detailed descriptions of some artifact types:

Trained statistical model

A trained statistical model is the output of a machine-learning algorithm.  The model is an opaque byte array, probably stored as a binary file in a Nexus repository.

Docker Image

A docker image is generated by the system, containing a microservice which in turn makes the trained statistical model usable.

* Validation status code

     - This refers to the validation result for the revision. It uses values defined by Validation Status Code (above).

* Version

     -   Chosen by the user. This serves as the solution's child revision entry identifier. This needs to be unique for any solution revision within the same solution.

* Create time

     -   The time when this revision of the solution is created

* Creator

     -   The person who created the revision of the solution (reference to the user table)


Step Result
^^^^^^^^^^^

This tracks the status of steps in the Acumos system by some actor or process. For example, the on-boarding feature can store information about the status and outcome of its steps.

Attributes:

* Step Result ID - generated
* Tracking ID - optional

     -  This represents a workflow execution instance. For example it may represent onboarding of a ML model workflow instance.

* Step type Code - required

     -   Represents the type of workflow being tracked- for example whether it is onboarding of ML model workflow, validation of a ML model workflow or something else. Currently onboarding and validation are the two types of workflows being identified, but this list will grow as the need for tracking additional workflows arise.

* Solution ID - optional
* Revision ID - optional
* Artifact ID - optional
* User ID - optional
* Name - required

     -   Represents the specific step involved in the workflow. For example for onboarding workflow, step name can "Soultion ID creation"

* Authentication mechanism (possibly Facebook, Github, Linked-in)
* Authentication token

     -   For example, JSON Web Token, which should be short (hundreds of bytes) but may be large (thousand of bytes). This will be used to Secure APIs after logging in.

* Levels of access

     -   For example, users might be modelers (data scientists) who upload models; integrators who build solutions in the design studio; or consumers who download and run solutions only.
     -   As one possible implementation, the EP-SDK represents privileges using roles and role functions.  A user is assigned one or more roles.  Each role is associated with one or more functions.  A function is a specific feature in the system. Still TBD if an external authentication system will deliver privileges like roles, or if all must be stored locally.

Users are related to user roles in a 1:many relationship; in other words, multiple roles may be assigned to a single user.

relationship, such as the time when it was created.

Please note this section does not document simple relationships managed within entities, which includes 
one-to-one and many-to-one relationships.  For example, every comment has the ID of the containing thread, 
so a separate table is not required to manage that relationship.
