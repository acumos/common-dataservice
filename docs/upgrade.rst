CDS Data Migrations and Upgrades
================================

This section explains the data upgrade SQL scripts and the data-migration tool
for the Common Data Service (CDS).


User and Author Data Upgrade for CDS 1.18.x
-------------------------------------------

This database script populates authorship details in models so that
they appear as expected in Portal-Markeplace verison 1.16.5 and later.
The script copies user first name, last name and email from the user
table to any solution revision that has no author details.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This migration tool requires a Acumos Common Data Service database at
version 1.18.x.

Script Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The text of the SQL script is available from the CDS gerrit repository at this URL::

    https://gerrit.acumos.org/r/gitweb?p=common-dataservice.git;a=blob;f=cmn-data-svc-server/db-scripts/cds-mysql-copy-user-author-1.18.sql

Run Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A database administrator should run this script in any affected
database using any appropriate administration tool.


CMS Admin and User Data Migration for CDS 2.0.x
-----------------------------------------------

This utility migrates all administrator and user data from the Hippo-CMS
system to the Common Data Service (version 2.0.x or later) and a Nexus
repository.  An early feature of Acumos stored admin and user data in CMS,
but later versions use CDS.  The following data items are affected:

#. Solution picture: a user can add a picture to a solution.
#. Revision descriptions: a user can add a description appropriate for
   the COMPANY access level and another description appropriate for the
   PUBLIC access level of a single revision. In other words, every
   revision can have zero, one or two descriptions.
#. Revision supporting documents: a user can upload many supporting
   documents for a revision, one set visible at the COMPANY access
   level and another set of documents visible at the PUBLIC access
   level. In other words, every revision can have an arbitrary number
   of supporting documents, divided into two sets.
#. Co-brand logo: a small image at the top left of the main landing page,
   which is chosen by the administrator.
#. Carousel images and infographics: the rotating pictures at the top
   of the main landing page, which are configured by the administrator.
#. Text that decorates the "Discover Acumos" graphic on the Marketplace,
   which can be changed by an administrator.
#. Footer contact details: contact details shown at the bottom right,
   which can be changed by an administrator.
#. Footer terms and conditions: shown in the page footer,
   which can be changed by an administrator.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using this migration tool requires the following prerequisites:
#. A running docker daemon
#. Network connectivity to the Acumos docker registry
#. Network access to the local Acumos Common Data Service instance, version 1.17.0 or later
#. Network access to the local Acumos Hippo-CMS instance
#. Network access to the local Acumos Nexus repository
#. Credentials to read from the local CMS instance
#. Credentials to write to the local CDS instance
#. Credentials to write to the local Nexus repository.

Migration Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose whether to migrate user data or admin data.  The user data migration is required
when upgrading from CDS version 1.17 to 1.18.  The admin data migration is required when
upgrading from CDS version 2.0 to 2.1.  Set the type in the configuration file as described
next.

After obtaining valid URLs, user names and passwords for all three systems, enter them
in a file named "migrate.properties" using the following structure::

    # one of: admin, user
    migrate.data.type = admin

    cds.url = http://cdshost.myproject.org:8001/ccds
    cds.user =
    cds.pass =

    cms.url = http://cmshost.myproject.org:8085/site
    cms.user =
    cms.pass =

    nexus.url = http://nexushost.myproject.org:8081/repository/repo_name
    nexus.user =
    nexus.pass =
    # this is the group prefix; a UUID compnent will be added
    nexus.prefix = org.acumos

Migration Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For user data, the migration tool discovers the list of solutions by querying CDS, checks
the content of each solution by querying CMS, and migrates content to CDS and Nexus as needed.
For admin data, the migration tool discovers the data by querying CMS, and migrates content
to CDS as needed.

The tool expects to be invoked with a properties file in the current directory. The tool logs
details of actions and results on the standard output.

Run the migration tool using the released Docker image as shown below::

    docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/migrate.properties:/maven/migrate.properties \
           nexus3.acumos.org:10002/migrate-cms-to-cds:2.0.0

Note that port 10002 refers to the docker "releases" registry. If the image is not found there,
it may be necessary to use a staged-for-release Docker image from the registry at port 10004::

    docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/migrate.properties:/maven/migrate.properties \
           nexus3.acumos.org:10004/migrate-cms-to-cds:2.0.0

When the tool is finished it reports statistics in this format::

    2019-05-02T18:49:26.101Z [main] INFO  o.a.cds.migrate.MigrateCmsToCdsApp - Migration statistics:
    2019-05-02T18:49:26.101Z [main] INFO  o.a.cds.migrate.MigrateCmsToCdsApp - Solutions checked: 474

    2019-05-02T18:49:26.101Z [main] INFO  o.a.cds.migrate.MigrateCmsToCdsApp - Global items migrated: 2 success, 0 fail

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of error, the tool can be run repeatedly on the same source and target.
It will not re-migrate data to CDS nor Nexus for any item.

The migration tool requires every document to have a file suffix that indicates the
type of document; e.g., ".doc" or ".xlsx".  A document without any suffix cannot be
migrated.  Add a suffix to the document name to fix this problem, then re-run the
migration process.
