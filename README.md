# Acumos Common Data Service

This repository holds the server and client components of the Common Data Service
for the Acumos machine-learning platform. The server exposes a REST interface for
a storage and query layer between system components and a relational database. The
client allows Java developers to access the REST endpoints easily.

Please see the documentation in the "docs" folder.

## Running

For development and testing purposes, working from this source tree you can start an
instance of the CDS server that uses an in-memory database like this:

    cd cmn-data-svc-client
    mvn install
    cd ../cmn-data-svc-server
    mvn spring-boot:run

You can configure the server to use a MariaDB or Mysql database by entering the URL,
username and password in file 'cmn-data-svc-server/config/application-mariadb.properties'
then launch the server using the following modified command much like above:

    mvn -Dspring.config.name=application-mariadb spring-boot:run

## Developers

Eclipse and Spring Tool Suite IDE users should install the plugin "m2e-apt" from the
Eclipe Marketplace.
