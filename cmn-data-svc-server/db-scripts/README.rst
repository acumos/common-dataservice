==================================
Acumos Common Data Service Scripts
==================================

This directory has scripts for creating and populating a database used by the Common Data Service.
The simple semantic versioning system for scripts uses only 2 digits. So for example, database 
scripts at version 1.3 can support service version 1.3.0, version 1.3.1 and so on.  That last
digit refers to bug fixes and other changes that do not break the API contracts.
